A basic website that showcase what I do professionally. It contains an about me section, home section, services I render, hobbies and Skills section, and a contact-me page that opens in a separate page when clicked.

## Registration Form:

This form allows users to register by inputting the required data in the space provided. It doesn't submit if the mandatory spaces are left blank and will notify you on that regard. The correct input format must also be adhered to for successful submission.

A _login link_ is attached at the bottom of the form for users who are already registered to proceed to the **_login page_**.

## Login Page:

A link leading to **_Registration form_** is placed at the bottom for users without an account.

## Success Page:

This page displays upon successful login to the platform.

### Technologies Used:
